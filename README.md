# Air_Quality_Detection_ML

## Introduction
The Air Quality Detection ML project to classifies the Air Quality Index (AQI) into various categories. By utilizing  Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, and XGBoost Models along with ARIMA for time series forecasting, this project aims to provide accurate AQI predictions, which are crucial for monitoring environmental quality and public health.

## Features
- Efficient feature selection.
- Use of oversampling techniques to handle imbalanced datasets.
- Cross Validation.
- Implementation of SVM with RBF kernel for high-accuracy classification (before and after oversampling).
- Implementation of Decision Tree Model
- Implementation of XGBoost Model

## Dataset
- Includes a wide range of air quality parameters collected from various monitoring stations. It has been preprocessed and partitioned into training, validation, and test sets to ensure a robust learning process.
- Source: Air quality observations spanning from January 15, 2015, to July 1, 2020 obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), India.
